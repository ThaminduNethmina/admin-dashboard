# SEDS-OUSL Demo

This is a demo site for the interview process of the SEDS-OUSL.

## Setup and Run the Site with React and Vite

To setup and run this website using React with Vite, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd /path/to/admin-dashboard/
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the following command:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Vite will automatically open a new browser tab with the SEDS-OUSL demo website running. If it doesn't, you can manually open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

The site is also hosted in the netlify. Navigate to `https://seds-ousl.netlify.app/`
